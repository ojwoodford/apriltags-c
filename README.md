# apriltags-c

AprilTags are a family of uniquely identifiable, visual fiducial markers designed by [Ed Olsen](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/people/ebolson/). This repository contains a copy of the C-language version of the AprilTag detector written by Olsen himself, and downloaded from [here](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html). That page also has the tags themselves available for download.
